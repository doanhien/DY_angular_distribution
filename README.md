# DY_angular_distribution
To create minitrees, we need:
1. tree.h to declare, define variables you need
2. xAna.C: main code, however, in this version the Lorentz boost is not correct here
To use the correct boost, check: ana.C

3. dataFitFunc.C: fit cosTheta and phi distribution from data using the functional form
